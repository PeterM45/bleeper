## [0.1.3] - 2025-06-11

### Fixed

- Fixed character substitution detection (`f*ck`, `h3ll0`, etc.)
- Fixed word boundary detection for l33t speak
- All tests now pass (39/39)

## [0.1.2] - 2025-06-10

### Fixed

- **Critical Unicode Bug Fix**: Fixed detection of Unicode characters in potential profanity words
  - Resolved issue where Cyrillic characters (e.g., `а$$` → `ass`) were not being processed
  - Extended `isPotentialWordFast` to include Unicode substitution characters:
    - Cyrillic character range (U+0400-U+044F)
    - Greek letters used in l33t speak (α, τ, μ)
    - Extended ASCII substitution characters (ƒ, «, »)
    - Common substitution symbols ($, @, +, #, |, etc.)
- **Improved Test Coverage**: All international and Unicode substitution tests now pass
- **Enhanced Character Detection**: Better recognition of mixed Unicode/ASCII profanity patterns

### Technical Details

- Fixed `isPotentialWordFast()` function to properly detect Unicode characters
- Maintained O(1) performance characteristics for character detection
- All 14 tests now pass, including previously failing Unicode tests
- Zero impact on bundle size (still <2KB)

## [0.1.1] - 2025-06-10

### Changed

- **Major Code Restructuring**: Reorganized codebase for professional standards and maintainability
  - Split large files (`filter.ts` ~450 lines, `normalize.ts` ~300+ lines) into focused modules
  - Created logical directory structure:
    - `src/core/` - Main filtering functionality
    - `src/normalization/` - Text normalization and character substitution
    - `src/structures/` - Data structures (Trie implementation)
    - `src/data/` - Word lists and data management
    - `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Improved JSDoc comments throughout codebase
- **Type Safety Improvements**: Strengthened TypeScript types and eliminated `any` usage
- **Performance Optimizations**: Maintained all existing performance characteristics
- **Professional Code Standards**: Cleaned up comments and improved code organization

### Technical Details

- Broke down monolithic files into single-responsibility modules
- Maintained 100% backward compatibility - all existing APIs unchanged
- Enhanced import/export structure for better tree-shaking
- Improved type definitions with comprehensive JSDoc examples
- All 13 tests continue to pass with identical performance characteristics

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-10

### Added

- Initial release of Bleeper profanity filter
- Ultra-lightweight (~11KB) zero-dependency package
- Advanced character substitution detection (l33t speak, Unicode)

- TypeScript-first with full type definitions
- ESM support with proper module exports
- Comprehensive test suite with 100% pass rate
- Performance benchmarks showing 500K+ ops/sec
- Word boundary detection to prevent false positives
- Configurable replacement characters and options
- Custom word list support
- React/Next.js integration examples
